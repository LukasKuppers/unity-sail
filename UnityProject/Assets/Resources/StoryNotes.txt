However, beware: we are legally obligated to inform you that all previous privateers we commissioned have not returned. You may encounter pirates or ships of the royal navy who seek to claim the goods and land which is rightly ours! \n\nYou have been provided with the Cog at our port, Eureka Trading Post. We offer protection at this port, and in return you will bring us treasures and navigation data. You may purchase goods or new ships with the compensation collected for your work. \n\nGood luck explorer, \n\nHead Commissioner of The Eureka Trading Company"
1	Bartholomew - Rumors of danger	"Hello my dear, \n\nI hope you are well. Business goes well at the tavern, Ale is the most precious of commodities in these corners of the world! Soon enough I'll have stored up enough coin to bring back to you. \n\nBut not everything is perfect in the new world. Rumors are going around that ships are going missing far more often than usual. A captain came through just today tellin' me that his merchant comrade left for a one-day delivery a week ago and never returned. \n\nlost men are washin' up on shore too! they've always gone insane, raving about pure nonsense. Don't be worried about me though, I don't set foot on any ships! The tavern's good enough for me. \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
