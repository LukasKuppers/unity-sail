However, beware: we are legally obligated to inform you that all previous privateers we commissioned have not returned. You may encounter pirates or ships of the royal navy who seek to claim the goods and land which is rightly ours! \nYou have been provided with the Cog at our port, Eureka Trading Post. We offer protection at this port, and in return you will bring us treasures and navigation data. You may purchase goods or new ships with the compensation collected for your work. \nGood luck explorer, \nHead Commissioner of The Eureka Trading Company"
