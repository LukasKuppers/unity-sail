1	Bartholomew - Rumors	"Hello my dear, \n\nI hope you are well. Business goes well at the tavern, Ale is the most precious of commodities in these corners of the world! Soon enough I'll have stored up enough coin to bring back to you. \n\nBut not everything is perfect in the new world... Rumors are going around that ships are going missing far more often than usual. A captain came through just today tellin' me that his merchant comrade left for a one-day delivery a week ago and never returned. \n\nLost men are washin' up on shore too! they've always gone insane, raving about pure nonsense. Don't be worried about me though, I don't set foot on any ships! The tavern's good enough for me. \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
2	Bartholomew - Sea Beast	"Hello dear, \n\nI don't wish to worry you, but you made me promise I'd tell you everything that happens overseas. I'm a man of my word. \n\nMore rumors are goin' round about the missing ships. A lighthouse keeper came through sayin' he saw a ship get pulled under the sea in the blink of an eye - hittin a reef couldn't do that! Word's also goin' around about a shipwrecked sailor more sane than the rest. He claims his ship was destroyed by a huge beast under the surface! Other sailors in the taver say they've seen a beast three-fold larger than a humpback whale swim right under the waves! \n\nMy comrade Ishmael said He's gonna set out and find out what's going on. He's taking a whole Man O' War to kill the damn thing! \n\nI'll assure you again though dear, that I'm safe. I stay on the island where there are no beasts. \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
3	Bartholomew - Coming home	"Hello my dear, \n\nI'm coming home, on the next ship out of this place! \n\nBusiness has run dry, sailors are leaving in flocks cause the sea's just too dangerous. Even I'm afraid the ship home might not make it! \n\nIshmael never returned from his voyage, it's been weeks since he set out. Nothing from his ship's washed up, but I'm afraid he's gone. Everyone's talking about a sea beast now, it must be real. \n\nWish me luck dear, I'll see you soon... \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
4	Ishmaels plea for rescue	"Please! I need help! \n\nAbout a week ago I set out to find this damn sea beast. We saw nothing, and I doubted it even existed, until yesterday. \n\nJust at dusk the damn thing wrapped around my whole vessel and pulled her under! in the blink of an eye! As far as I can tell I'm the only man who didn't go down with it. \n\nI've washed up on Skull Isle, just my luck... \n\nI've found some food and made a fire, but I won't last long! \n\nA captain no longer, \n\nIshmael"
5	Captain Jane Commission	"Hello Capt. Jane, \n\nWe are glad you have chosen to provide your esteemed talents to the Eureka Trading Compnay. We hope you will be successful in assisting us with discovering riches in the New World. \n\nRumors say that these shores are rich with treasure of forgoten peoples. But be warned Jane, pirates and the Navy have the same intention as us, and they will resort to violence in these uncharted seas. \n\nBring any treasures you find to the Eureka Trading Post, and you will be generously compensated. \n\nGood luck, \n\nHead Commissioner of the Eureka Trading Company"
6	Admiral Knox - Greetings	"Greetings, your Highness, \n\nI am writing you promptly after completing the treacherous journey to the New World. The shores here are despicable, I would much rather spend time in your royal courts. However, I smell opportunity and great treasure. The men inform me that there is no shortage of gold to be found. \n\nThere are also, it seems, no shortage of scoundrels wishing to take the riches that are rightly yours. I will assert domination along this coast, by whatever means necessary. \n\nRaging drunkards have told me of great ancient power which we may be able to wield. While I despise drunkards and the things they say, I will investigate this nonetheless. \n\nSincerely, \n\nAdmiral Knox
7	Captain Jane's Log 12	"Today was a sad day. A shipwreck washed up on the shore of the island we were moored at and it was a sobering sight. Hardly any of the ship was left, not even enough to identify it. \n\nLast night the New World was hit with a tropical storm larger than most I've encountered in my time here and luckily we were moored in this sheltered cove. However, these poor sailors clearly did not have the same luxury. Not many bodies could be found, likely most were dragged out to sea. We did find one unfortunate soul, still barely alive, with a serious head injury. We tried to get some information about their ship out of him, so we could at least send word of the wreck to the sailors families, but he just blathered on about some sea beast and insisted that it had, infact, caused the wreck. His head wound and the trauma of the events past must have been too much for the poor fellow. He died shortly after our encounter."
8	Remains of a creature	"Observations of the New World - June 28 \n\n\nSome weeks ago a crew from the Royal Navy invited me to join them on an expidition along the northern coast of the New World. Their aim is to find treasure (of which they have found very much). However, my aim is to continue my biological studies and take account of the peculiar life existing in these unknown areas. \n\nThis morning we explored the beaches of a small island, where I discovered an incredible skeleton. \n\n The skeleton is a large, elongated rib cage - similar to that of a whale. However, this skeleton is extremely long, and I suppose it would lie in the territory of three times larger than an aduld humpback. \n\n Certaintly this skeleton is from a creature never seen alive, and there is no doubt that no skeletons of this kind have been found along the coast at home. I imagine the species from whence it came must be extinct. \n\n\nHeny, student of the esteemed university of flora and fauna."
9	Discomfort	"Somethings not right... I can feel it in me bones! The winds have shifted and I keep feeling a chill up me spine, though it's been quite a warm summer. Probably another sign!! \n\nSometimes I think I been seeing something under the ship. Deep in the depths. A massive shadow. Somethings not right and my bones are telling me so. \n\nNote to self. Do not let the captain find you writing these jornals again. The last time he did it you scrubbed the poop deck for weeks..."
10	Naval Report	"Admiral, \n\nIn Success is ours. This excursion has prooved to be more than we ever could have hoped. Control of this world and its riches are in our grasp. \n\nI would have hoped our subordinates could understand the gravity of this mission, alas, just this last week I found a deckhand writing superstitous journal entries like a school girl. Had to throw the thing overboard. You may want to keep an eye on your crew as well and up the discipline so that we are not hindered by our own troops."
