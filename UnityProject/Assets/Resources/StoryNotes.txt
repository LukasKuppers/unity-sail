1	Bartholomew - Rumors of danger	"Hello my dear, \n\nI hope you are well. Business goes well at the tavern, Ale is the most precious of commodities in these corners of the world! Soon enough I'll have stored up enough coin to bring back to you. \n\nBut not everything is perfect in the new world. Rumors are going around that ships are going missing far more often than usual. A captain came through just today tellin' me that his merchant comrade left for a one-day delivery a week ago and never returned. \n\nlost men are washin' up on shore too! they've always gone insane, raving about pure nonsense. Don't be worried about me though, I don't set foot on any ships! The tavern's good enough for me. \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
2	Bartholomew - beastly rumors	"Hello dear, \n\nI don't wish to worry you, but you made me promise I'd tell you everything that happens overseas. I'm a man of my word. \n\nMore rumors are goin' round about the missing ships. A lighthouse keeper came through sayin' he saw a ship get pulled under the sea in the blink of an eye - hittin a reef couldn't do that! Word's also goin' around about a shipwrecked sailor more sane than the rest. He claims his ship was destroyed by a huge beast under the surface! Other sailors in the taver say they've seen a beast bigger than a humpback whale swim right under the waves! \n\nI'm not sure they can all be trusted though, cause I've been giving them too much ale! \n\nI'll assure you again though dear, that I'm safe. I stay on the island where there are no beasts. \n\nLove, \n\nBartholomew"
